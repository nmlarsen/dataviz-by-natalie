# Final Project, Part 1

### Outline

##### Summary:
I'll be telling a story of the importance of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) education in the United States. Below are some initial ideas for the story arc and overall layout of the final design. I plan on articulating why the traditional STEM approach is no longer enough, and then getting into why the addition of the arts is critical for students' success.
