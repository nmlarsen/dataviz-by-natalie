# Final Project, Part 1

### Outline

##### Summary:
I'll be telling a story of the importance of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) education in the United States. Below are some initial ideas for the story arc and overall layout of the final design. I plan on articulating why the traditional STEM approach is no longer enough, and then getting into why the addition of the arts is critical for students' success.

### Initial sketches
The first sketches are designed to show the failure of STEM education on its own. Below is an initial sketch of two important facts. Despite the fact that 4 out of 5 high school students choose to pursue a STEM path in college, only 1 of 5 students actually feel ready to take on a the rigour of STEM majors.

I will also explain in text that the demand for workers in STEM jobs is growing (an 8.8% expected growth in STEM jobs is predicted), but the readiness of students upon entering a STEM field is less than ideal. I want to quote a Harvard Gazette article that states that a revitilization of of the vision of STEM education is desperately needed in the US, especially in low-income/socio-economically disadvantaged schools, both in urban and rural areas of the country. I also want to mention the detrimental effect of the No Child Left Behind Act on public education due to its heavy focus on standardized testing and core curriculum that often excluded the arts.

I then want connect that data to the arts by showing that lack of support for arts programs and a failure to prioritize arts education exists and may be a partial cause for this issue. Below is an initial chart visualization the 26 states (including DC) that currently list and arts requirement for graduating high school.

Next, I want to focus on the benefits of arts education for students, particularly how they enhance students' academic performance, college-readiness, critial thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The last point will likely be explained in text rather than visualized in a graph, as this information is difficult to quantify.

To show that the majority of Americans believe in an arts education, I want to display the following chart to go along with the facts that 91% of Americans who believe the arts are part of a well-rounded education, and that 90% of Americans believe the arts should be taught in schools.

Finally, I want to showcase the data that supports the implementation of STEAM education and general academic achievement in the US. The two keys facts I want to present are students who participate in the arts are 4 times more likely to participate in a math or science fair, and that socioeconomically disadvantaged high school students who participate in the arts have a dropout rate of 4%, compared to their peers who do not participate in the arts, who have a dropout rate of 22%. I want to be sure to show that regardless of location and level of advantage/disadvantage, students benefit from arts education being added to their schools' curriculum.

Other statistics I want to include here are that arts-participating students score, on average, 98 points highter on the SAT than their non-arts-participating peers.

There is also some qualitative data that I want to showcase through text. I want to bring up how underreprested Black, Hispanic, and women workers are in many STEM fields, and how the arts can be used as a catalyst to encourage diversification because of its emphasis on collaborative efforts and empathy-building.

My call to action for readers will be to simply understand the benefits of the arts. I want to leave them with a feeling of motivation to participate in the arts, whether it's by going to arts events or engaging in a hobby such as drawing or playing music. Many adults have had arts experiences in the past throughout grade school, and I want them to remember how they enjoyed being in a dance class, participating in a school play, playing an instrument, or drawing comics. I also want to encourage readers to pay attention to which political candidates support funding for arts education and believe in its place in public schools. I may include an example of a success story where a school district implemented an arts requirement and saw positive changes in students' learning, college readiness, and overall behavior.

### Data
Below is a complilation of the data I intend to use, at least so far. I plan on incorporating this data into my story arc a few different ways. First, I want to emphasize the fact that STEM education curricula are not enough. Students are clearly not prepared enough for the rigors of studying a STEM area in college, which leaves them ill-prepared for when they graduate and enter the workforce. Second, I want to show how the incorporation of the arts into a K-12 education increases students' academic performance and leads to higher levels of college applicants and attendees. Finally, I want to show how incorporating the arts in the the STEM model leads to better outcomes than the STEM approach alone. Although it's difficult to quantify levels of creativity, innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, a case can be made for STEAM by simply showing that what has been implemented in public education since the No Child Left Behind Act has not worked.




Additionally, I have included a publically accessible [Google Sheet]([url](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sM2aU3STtZp0BSNnHBKjgApe9CHwJXGIYEbgtS6KMvo/edit?usp=sharing)) in case there are any changes or additions.

### Method and medium
I plan on using Dillinger.io to begin building out the text portions of the final project. This will allow me to easily compare the markdown code I'm using to the output. I will create all visuals on Flourish and may use Tableau if I feel comfortable enough. Flourish has been very user-friendly for someone who doesn't have much experience with creating data visualizations from scratch. However, if I feel that Tableau could accomplish something Flourish could not, such as creating map charts in a simpler way, I will make that adjustment as needed. I also plan to utilize Canva and Unsplash for public domain images and any other graphics I may include. The final project will be presented on ShortHand.com. 

### Peer feedback from 9/27/22
When I presented my outline in class, I was told that I may be trying to squeeze in a lot of information that may circumvent the message of the story, and they didn't fully get what my message was. One question that was presented was whether I was trying to focus on college attendence or academic performance in high school. Their suggestions were then to just focus on arts education on its own rather than STEAM vs. STEM. I feel as though arts education is a trite topic and that my topic presentes a slightly different angle. So, I decided to "mindmap" all my ideas and data points in Miro to see if I can achieve more clarity.
