# Final Project, Part 1

### Outline

##### Summary:
I'll be telling a story of the importance of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) education in the United States. Below are some initial ideas for the story arc and overall layout of the final design. I plan on articulating why the traditional STEM approach is no longer enough, and then getting into why the addition of the arts is critical for students' success.

### Initial sketches
The first sketches are designed to show the failure of STEM education on its own. Below is an initial sketch of two important facts. Despite the fact that 4 out of 5 high school students choose to pursue a STEM path in college, only 1 of 5 students actually feel ready to take on a the rigour of STEM majors.
