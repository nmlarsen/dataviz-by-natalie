# Final Project, Part 1

### Outline

##### Summary:
I'll be telling a story of the importance of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) education in the United States. Below are some initial ideas for the story arc and overall layout of the final design. I plan on articulating why the traditional STEM approach is no longer enough, and then getting into why the addition of the arts is critical for students' success.

### Initial sketches
The first sketches are designed to show the failure of STEM education on its own. Below is an initial sketch of two important facts. Despite the fact that 4 out of 5 high school students choose to pursue a STEM path in college, only 1 of 5 students actually feel ready to take on a the rigour of STEM majors.

I will also explain in text that the demand for workers in STEM jobs is growing, but the readiness of students upon entering a STEM field is less than ideal. I want to quote a Harvard Gazette article that states that a revitilization of of the vision of STEM education is desperately needed in the US, especially in low-income/socio-economically disadvantaged schools, both in urban and rural areas of the country.

I then want connect that data to the arts by showing that lack of support for arts programs and a failure to prioritize arts education exists and may be a partial cause for this issue. Below is an initial chart visualization the 26 states (including DC) that currently list and arts requirement for graduating high school.

Next, I want to focus on the benefits of arts education for students, particularly how they enhance students' academic performance, college-readiness, critial thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The last point will likely be explained in text rather than visualized in a graph, as this information is difficult to quantify.

To show that the majority of Americans believe in an arts education, I want to display the following chart to go along with the fact that 90% of Americans believe the arts should be taught in schools. Although I may change it to represent the 91% of Americans who believe the arts are part of a well-rounded education. This fact seems to be more compelling and supports my key message more.
