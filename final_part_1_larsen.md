# Final Project, Part 1

### Outline

##### Summary:
I'll be telling a story of the importance of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, math) education in the United States. Below are some initial ideas for the story arc and overall layout of the final design. I plan on articulating why the traditional STEM approach is no longer enough, and then getting into why the addition of the arts is critical for students' success.

### Initial sketches
The first sketches are designed to show the failure of STEM education on its own. Below is an initial sketch of two important facts. Despite the fact that 4 out of 5 high school students choose to pursue a STEM path in college, only 1 of 5 students actually feel ready to take on a the rigour of STEM majors.

I will also explain in text that the demand for workers in STEM jobs is growing, but the readiness of students upon entering a STEM field is less than ideal. I want to quote a Harvard Gazette article that states that a revitilization of of the vision of STEM education is desperately needed in the US, especially in low-income/socio-economically disadvantaged schools, both in urban and rural areas of the country.

I then want connect that data to the arts by showing that lack of support for arts programs and a failure to prioritize arts education exists and may be a partial cause for this issue. Below is an initial chart visualization the 26 states (including DC) that currently list and arts requirement for graduating high school.

Next, I want to focus on the benefits of arts education for students, particularly how they enhance students' academic performance, college-readiness, critial thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. The last point will likely be explained in text rather than visualized in a graph, as this information is difficult to quantify.

To show that the majority of Americans believe in an arts education, I want to display the following chart to go along with the fact that 90% of Americans believe the arts should be taught in schools. Although I may change it to represent the 91% of Americans who believe the arts are part of a well-rounded education. This fact seems to be more compelling and supports my key message more.

Finally, I want to showcase the data that supports the implementation of STEAM education in the US. The two keys facts I want to present are that students who participate in STEAM learning are 21% more likely to attend college. And 29% of students are more likely to apply for postsecondary education than their non-arts peers.

There is also some qualitative data that I want to showcase through text. 

### Data
Below is a complilation of the data I intend to use, at least so far. I plan on incorporating this data into my story arc a few different ways. First, I want to emphasize the fact that STEM education curricula are not enough. Students are clearly not prepared enough for the rigors of studying a STEM area in college, which leaves them ill-prepared for when they graduate and enter the workforce. Second, I want to show how the incorporation of the arts into a K-12 education increases students' academic performance and leads to higher levels of college applicants and attendees. Finally, I want to show how incorporating the arts in the the STEM model leads to better outcomes than the STEM approach alone. Although it's difficult to quantify levels of creativity, innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, a case can be made for STEAM by simply showing that what has been implemented in public education since the No Child Left Behind Act has not worked.

Additionally, I have included a publically accessible [Google Sheet]([url](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sM2aU3STtZp0BSNnHBKjgApe9CHwJXGIYEbgtS6KMvo/edit?usp=sharing)) in case there are any changes or additions: 

### Method and medium
I plan on using Dillinger.io to begin building out the text portions of the final project. This will allow me to easily compare the markdown code I'm using to the output. I will create all visuals on Flourish and may use Tableau if I feel comfortable enough. Flourish has been very user-friendly for someone who doesn't have much experience with creating data visualizations from scratch. However, if I feel that Tableau could accomplish something Flourish could not, such as creating map charts in a simpler way, I will make that adjustment as needed. The final project will be presented on ShortHand.com.
