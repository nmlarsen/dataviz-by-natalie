# Critique by Design

### Step 1:

The data visualization I chose to work with was the graph pictured below from Americans for the Arts (AFTA).

<img width="600" alt="2022-09-14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112141969/191055022-6dd3fd9d-67fe-4d22-a81b-89d68ef015e4.png">

This graph comes from the 2022 Congressional Arts Handbook, which serves as a guide to arts and cultural policy advocates, giving them key facts, figures, and talking points.<sup>1</sup> Graphs and visuals from AFTA are typically very plain and simple, rarely going beyond a white background with black text. But they are always part of a larger story of why the arts are so important in the U.S. In this graph, the message is right in the title, "NEA Funding Fails to Keep Pace With Inflation."<sup>2</sup>

I wanted to work with this graph and accompanying data because arts policy and advocacy has become my target focus since starting graduate school at Carnegie Mellon. The arts are often the first to get their budgets cut. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) does incredible work for arts programs, educators, and practitioners throughout the United States, but has historically been underfunded. As a result, students, teachers, artists, audiences, and arts organizations suffer. As we navigate our way through a post-pandemic world, funding for the arts has become even more crucial. Investment in the arts has shown significant economic benefits time and time again. I firmly believe in the power of the arts to provide healing and hope, and to help the US economy recover from the impacts of COVID-19. I support the work AFTA does. However, much of their visual elements, from their data visualizations to their website content, can be improved. 

Since only the data on NEA appropriations was provided, I determined the amounts adjusted for inflation using the U.S. Inflation Calculator, double-checking my calculations against the graph provided to ensure its accuracy. 


### Step 2:

Using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile<sup>3</sup>, I ranked each element the following:


##### Usefulness : 9

As far as the audience's needs go, this data objectively provides the necessary information on the NEA's appropriations history. It then compares that data to what NEA funding could have been if the federal government kept up with the pace of inflation. In my opinion, this is an important point to make when making a case for the arts in order to provide context to policymakers.

##### Completeness: 7

I think this information could have been effective if it were compared to other agencies that receive federal funds as their primary source of income to show the disparity. For example, if comparing the appropriation history of the NEA to the National Science Foundation, I can only imagine that there would be a significant difference between the two. 

Alternatively, if it were compared to other federal organizations involved in the arts and humanities (such as the National Endowment for the Humanities or the Corporation for Public Broadcasting), the case that the arts and humanities are consistently underfunded could be cemented. 

##### Perceptibility: 5

I found the graph to be fairly easy to understand. But because of the poor design and the placement of the graph in the middle of a 40-page report, I thought that a reader might skip over it since it is just more of the same black and white design. After having gone through about 20 pages already,  it may take a reader a minute or so before to interpret the graph. I felt that the overall design didn't present anything captivating that would communicate the message clearly upon first glance, aside from the "$178 Million Difference" in red text inside the yellow box. Even that might take a minute to understand because the reader's eye will be drawn there first, but it is unclear what the disparity in dollar amounts is referring to. It wasn't until I read the title, the key, and looked at the two lines for context that I understood what it meant.

##### Truthfulness: 10

I did not come across any aspect of the graph that could be misconstrued or misrepresented. The data used to create the graph is correct and can be found easily through a simple Google search. Furthermore, the dataset for NEA appropriations have been provided on the page just prior to this graph. Upon further analyzing the graph, all the intervals on the x and y-axes were accurate and consistent. Nothing was manipulated in a way to deceive the reader. And the title was not "click-bait-y," but rather communicated the intention of the graph objectively.

##### Intuitiveness: 5

Building on my thoughts of the perceptibility of the graph, I think that the overall design of the report doesn’t allow for a reader to intuitively interpret a graph with such little effort put into the design. However, the overall form is easy to understand for any reader. The "$178 Million Difference" in red text inside the yellow box indicates some sort of significant discrepancy. And the dotted line signifies something that is either projected or alternate to this solid line. 


##### Aesthetics: 1

This graph is not visually appealing. It's not that it has bad visualization techniques, but more a lack thereof. The lack of color is not pleasing to look at. The red text in the yellow box draws attention, but not because it is pleasant to look. It's just the item that stands out amidst the black and white. The graph almost reminds me of a graph presented in the GRE or some other type of exam that I have to answer questions about. 

##### Engagement: 3

I don’t feel that there is much to the graph that entices the reader to dig into it any deeper. The lack of color and other visual pleasantries make it feel very much like any other traditional graph in a business report. The information in the graph is important for a policymaker or arts advocate to know. But it is presented in a way that makes it feel unimportant. In the context of the entire report, there is nothing unique about the design that makes a reader want to investigate it further.
