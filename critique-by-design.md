# Critique by Design

### Step 1:

The data visualization I chose to work with was the graph pictured below from Americans for the Arts (AFTA).

This graph comes from the 2022 Congressional Arts Handbook, which serves as a guide to arts and cultural policy advocates, giving them key facts, figures, and talking points.<sup>1</sup> Graphs and visuals from AFTA are typically very plain and simple, rarely going beyond a white background with black text. But they are always part of a larger story of why the arts are so important in the U.S. In this graph, the message is right in the title, "NEA Funding Fails to Keep Pace With Inflation."<sup>2</sup>

I wanted to work with this graph and accompanying data because arts policy and advocacy has become my target focus since starting graduate school at Carnegie Mellon. The arts are often the first to get their budgets cut. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) does incredible work for arts programs, educators, and practitioners throughout the United States, but has historically been underfunded. As a result, students, teachers, artists, audiences, and arts organizations suffer. As we navigate our way through a post-pandemic world, funding for the arts has become even more crucial. Investment in the arts has shown significant economic benefits time and time again. I firmly believe in the power of the arts to provide healing and hope, and to help the US economy recover from the impacts of COVID-19. I support the work AFTA does. However, much of their visual elements, from their data visualizations to their website content, can be improved. 

Since only the data on NEA appropriations was provided, I determined the amounts adjusted for inflation using the U.S. Inflation Calculator, double-checking my calculations against the graph provided to ensure its accuracy.
