# Final Project, Part III

## Changes made
Revised text to finalize narrative
Want to show detrimental effect of NCLBA on arts education
Found new information from sources that would further my point

## Audience
Considered differnt audiences/stakeholders who would be interested (or should be interested) in this topic. 
Parents
Teachers
Policymakers
Artist/arts practitioners

## Design
To make the presentation more aesthetically appealing, I added some stock images I found.
Solidified color schemes per section to make them distinguishable
Changed red to make it pop more and look less bleh

## Final presentation
Considered class of only 2 MAM's who would know the terminology, so made sure to make it accessible by expanding on defitions of STEAM and "the arts." Some of the peer feedback I received was a lack of understanding of how the arts connect to STEM in general. I tried to make that adjustment through the narrative overall as best as I could.

## Final thoughts
Lots of work
Interesting to dig into a subject I had already been exploring for an article I was writing
Humble brag: https://amt-lab.org/blog/2022/9/the-arts-education-for-all-act-a-catalyst-for-steam-education
