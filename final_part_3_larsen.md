# Final Project, Part III

## Changes made
Taking the feedback I received for part II into consideration, I wanted to ensure that the final product was easily understandable for both arts practitioners/educations and those who may lean more towards STEM subjects. My goal was to successfully make the information appealing to both sides (in a sort of a meeting of "right brain" and "left brain" folks).

My biggest concern was whether the story had a logical flow to it. I drew out the outline one more time using post-it notes on my wall so I could interact with the ideas in a hands-on way. My goal for doing this was the figure out the setup, problem, and resolution/call to action to resolve the problem. It definitely helped me restructure things and figure out what was important to include, what was more of a supportive element, and what was not important at all in this context.

Once I felt confident that this was the story I wanted to tell, and the order in which I wanted to tell it, I began revising the text in order to finalize the narrative. I also found some additional sources and data that supported my message. The issue then became that I had a lot of information and needed to figure out which points were the most critical for understanding the story. I went back to my outline (as seen above) and decided on the data points that would support each story element the most. Whenever I was in doubt about anything, I consulted the outline and asked myself if the data/visualization supported the story. 

I did more reading on the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 and hadn't realized previously how damaging it was to schools in general, let alone arts education programs. I wanted to be sure to include this information to give a bit more background on where the lack of support for the arts in schools came from and show how reversable it is. Finding specific data that relates to the enactment of this Act, however, was difficult. I looked at arts education funding compared it to overall education funding, but was unsure if I was finding accurate numbers, as there were significant discrepencies.

This brings me to my second concern, which was ensuring that I had the data to back up my points. Many of the benefits of arts education are qualitative and difficult to measure. And many of the reports and article I found mainly discussed these kinds of benefits (increased confidence, sense of community, compassion, empathy, critical thinking, creativity, etc.) While these are certainly worth noting, it took a little bit more digging to finding quantitative data points that I could visualize. I even found a few studies that had been done on STEAM programs for students of varying ages, but none that gave me any quantitative data to work with. 

## Audience
For this topic, I considered differnt audiences/stakeholders who would be interested (or should be interested). I decided on including parents, teachers, policymakers, and artist. Each audience member would have a different call to action that I thought about carefully. I wanted to ensure that each course of action was realistic and actionable enough to where it wouldn't impose a significant burden on the individual.

## Design
To make the presentation more aesthetically appealing, I made several broad changes. I first started looking into some stock images that supported the narrative. I thought this livened up the presentation overall and, from an artistic point of view, echoed the story points in each section. I tried to use mostly images with color, except for the "problem" section to showcase the bleakness of the state of arts education in the US. 

I also solidified the color scheme in both the website and the graphs. I changed the shade of red I had been using to a brighter shade to make it pop out more and bring attention to whatever I was highlighting. I then solidified color schemes in each section to make them distinguishable. 

For each graph, I had established the use of a darker blue to present the information I wanted the reader to see first, and the use of a lighter gray for the information that was secondary or being compared to. In all cases, I wanted the blue to represent what happened to students' performance when the arts were included in their lives. I also made sure to use the same font and format for all graphs as to not present anything new design-wise and risk confusing the reader.

## Final presentation
I considered the fact that there were only two Arts Management students in the class who would know the terminology, so made sure to make it accessible by expanding on defitions of STEAM and "the arts." Some of the peer feedback I received was a lack of understanding of how the arts connect to STEM in general. I tried to make that adjustment through the narrative overall as best as I could. My fear in presenting in one minute was making the information feel important and urgent. I focused on the primary story elements and hoped that the visualizations would speak for themselves. This was why I focused a lot of my time on making sure the visualizations all had a similar structure, text, and color scheme. I wanted to confuse the reader as little as possible. 

## Final thoughts
This final project took a lot of time and effort. But the information and data I uncovered was very interesting to me. I found myself going down several rabbit holes as a result of what I was reading about. It was especially interesting for me to explore this topic after having written a short [article]([url](https://amt-lab.org/blog/2022/9/the-arts-education-for-all-act-a-catalyst-for-steam-education)) (insert link) about it for AMT Lab (humble brag.) I think I ended up going in a slightly different direction with STEAM for this project than in my article. But I hope that it resulted in an interesting presentation and website in the end.
