Hello! My name is Natalie Larsen (she/her). I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm a musician-turned-arts manager/advocate. I'm passionate about conducting research in the arts to advocate for policies that would improve arts funding for independent artists, non-profit arts organizations, arts/STEAM education programs, and arts and cultural policies. By taking this class, I honed my data visualization skills and learned how to more effectively present information.

After this program, I hope to use data and research to support arts policy, arts and community development efforts and/or consulting work with arts nonprofit organizations.
