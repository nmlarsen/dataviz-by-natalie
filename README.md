# About me
Hello! My name is Natalie Larsen (she/her). I'm a second-year MAM student at CMU. I'm a musician-turned-arts manager/advocate.

# What I hope to learn
After this program, I hope to use data and research to support arts policy, arts and community development efforts and/or consulting work with arts nonprofit organizations. Throughout this class, I want to learn how to effectively communicate data findings through visualizations.

Check back later for some neat graphs! In the meantime, here is a photo of my two cats, Dee and Dennis.
