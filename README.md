Welcome to Natalie's Telling Stories with Data portfolio page.

# About me
Hello! My name is Natalie Larsen (she/her). I'm a second-year Master of Arts Management student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'm a musician-turned-arts manager/advocate. I'm passionate about conducting research on the arts in the United States to advocate for more equitable arts and cultural policies. My goal for this research is to improve funding for independent artists, non-profit arts organizations, arts/STEAM education programs, and community development/creative placemaking efforts. Throughout this class, I gained familiarity with Tableau, Flourish, and Github, learned how to achieve more clarity in my data visualizations, and gained a more critical understanding of graphs and charts through analysis and redesign exercises. I hope to continue using what I've learned in future courses and my future career.
