# GDP-to-Debt Ratio, 2020

For this assignment, I chose to work with government debt data from 2022. That graph below shows each countries government debt as a total percent of their GDP.

After taking the raw data and reworking it in Flourish, I separated each country to show how the debt to GDP ratio changed over time. The information is now displayed in individual line graphs.

I chose to work with a subset of data for the European Union, highlighting Eastern European countries' government debt.

In Flourish, I experimented with different types of charts (line graphs, projection maps, bubble charts, and treemaps) before settling on a bar chart. I was having trouble customizing some of the other chart types, so I decided to go with something simple. I set the default color to a light gray and then used the override feature to change each Eastern European country to red. I also set the legend filter to "multi-select" so the user can click on countries they want to compare.
