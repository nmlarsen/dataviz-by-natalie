# GDP-to-Debt Ratio, 2020

For this assignment, I chose to work with government debt data from 2020. That graph below shows each countries government debt as a total percent of their GDP.

After taking the raw data and reworking it in Flourish, I separated each country to show how the debt to GDP ratio changed over time. The information is now displayed in individual line graphs.

Next, I chose to work with a subset of data for countries in the European Union from 2000-2020, highlighting Poland's government debt.

In Flourish, I experimented with different types of charts (line graphs, projection maps, bubble charts, and treemaps) before settling on a line graph. I was having trouble customizing some of the other chart types, so I decided to go with something simple. I had to rework the dataset in Excel in order to work with the colors the way I wanted to. I set the color palette to a light gray and then used the override feature to change the line representing Poland to red. I also set the legend filter to "multi-select" so the user can click on countries they want to compare.
