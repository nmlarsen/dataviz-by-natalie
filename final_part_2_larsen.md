# Final Project, Part II

## Wireframe & Storyboard

I completed my wireframe/storyboard in ShortHand as a draft of the final project.

The main areas of focus are:
- Why STEM alone has not been effective in US public schools
- The benefits of arts education alone
- How the arts encourage STEM participation
- The current state of US government support for arts education
- The call to action/next steps

I adjusted my Miro board slightly from part 1 to expand on the call to action and how it might differ among audiences.

## User Research

I conducted user research by formulating some questions and then asking for feedback from three individuals.

Some additional feedback I received after the fact was including a navigation bar so readers can distinguish between the different sections since there does appear to be a lot of information. This would make it more digestible, especially for someone not as familiar with STEAM or arts education. 

## Moodboard

When looking for inspiration for the design, I began by looking at infographics on STEAM education. Personally, I feel that many infographics, visualizations, websites, and other images designed around the topic of education often feel juvenile. There are often too many images and colors, and not enough of a focus on clarity of the information being presented. In order for a reader to take this topic seriously, I want the design to appear serious. Below are some graphic examples I found that I liked for their color scheme, simplicity, font, and overall style.

I then experimented with several color palettes using Adobe Color. After finding an image I was considering using for the title, I extracted the color scheme from it and made some adjustments. I knew I wanted to include a shade of red to use for drawing attention to certain points, a lighter shade of gray to subdue unimportant bits of information.

I settled on the follow color palette after extracting the color scheme from an Unsplash image I thought would make a good title page image. I adjusted it slightly and added a darker shade of red intended to be used for calling out significant information.
