I completed my wireframe/storyboard in ShortHand as a draft of the final project.

## User Research

I conducted user research by formulating some questions and then asking for feedback from three individuals.

## Moodboard

When looking for inspiration for the design, I began by looking at infographics on STEAM education. Many infographics, visualizations, websites, and other images designed around the topic of education often feel juvenile. In my opinion, there are too many images, and colors, and not enough of a focus on clarity of the information being presented. In order for a reader to take this topic seriously, I want the design to appear serious. Below are some graphic examples I found that I liked for their color scheme, simplicity, and font.

I then experimented with several color palettes using Adobe Color. After finding an image I was considering using for the title, I extracted the color scheme from it and made some adjustments. I knew I wanted to include a shade of red to use for drawing attention to certain points, a lighter shade of gray to subdue unimportant bits of information.
